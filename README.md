## **Credits**

Thanks to my Mentor, Narender Singh, for his guide and support in the realization of this project.
Thanks to the useful reference and suggestions derived from sources listed below, I manage to gain a deeper understanding of how the various elements/components of HTML and CSS are used. In addition, continuous trial and error tests provided a useful means to further experiment on the usage of these two programming languages for the creation of the site.

- ### Content & Media
All of the contents on the website are customised and no design frameworks have been used for the realization of the site.
The idea of the Logo, the Navbar and the Footer were taken from the Love Running Project analysing and customizing their implementation for the created website.
I explored the writing part of the code and the best practices associated to this using the two sites listed below. Consulting those allowed me to further cement the learning gained during the Code Institute Course.
- [Medium.com](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
- [Learn.shayhowe.com](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)

After deciding to create a website for people who love food in one of the cooking sites I was often referring to (giallozafferano.com), opening the browser console, I came across the sign flex and tried to understand what it was. This led me to explore around several other websites including some tutorials on YouTube. 
This gave me the inspiration of implementing the use of flex boxes which was very important for the creation of the site. 
Listed here the Source of the studies:

One of the most complex pages for the implementation of the website was the Recipes Page. My mentor Narender Singh (Mentor) provided some materials where I could observe and study the implementation of sliders using only css with no JavaScript, generally used for these types of tasks. 

The following websites were inspirational for customizing the code of the slider to my needs:
- [Thanks to Chris Coyier for the Slider](https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/XwbNwX)

- [Thanks to Anna Blok for the Popup](https://codepen.io/anna_blok/pen/KKpwRVe)

- [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) was used to include the favicon in the website.
- [Cooks.com](https://www.cooks.com/) was used as reference for the creation of the recipes. 


For the realization of the 404 error page I found a guide on how to create the file here: 
- [Docs Github](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-custom-404-page-for-your-github-pages-site)

Thanks to Kasia Bogucka and Narender Singh for suggesting the use of github wiki site to create the Markdown file. They have also provided the link for the Sample Readme of Code Institute.
